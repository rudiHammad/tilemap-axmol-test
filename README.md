To test the project copy the content into you content, and overrite the AppDelegate.cpp, MainScene.cpp and MainScene.h (AppDeletate.h is the same than the defautl)

The video bellow shows the frame duration in Tiled compared to the one in axmol. If you are not familiar with tiled, the video shows how you
can set each frame duration, in this case all are 100ms excep the frame with the violet tile which is 1000 ms.
As you can see in Axmol, the frame duration is not correct. We should be seeing the same result we see in Tiled.
